Taught by Dr. Amin Rahman. 

This course will provide an introduction to the use of computers in solving 
problems arising in the physical, biological, and engineering sciences.  Various computational 
approaches commonly used to solve mathematical problems will be presented, including systems of linear equations, optimization, curve fitting, integration, and differential equations.  Both the theory and applications of each numerical method will be demonstrated.
